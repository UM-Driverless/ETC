 * Global variables.
 * Here they are defined (reserved memory for them), and elsewhere in the files they shall be declared to be used locally with the keyword "extern".
 * To do that, the file "global.h" can be used. In that way, when we change the type or name of a global variable, 
 * we won't have to edit every single file where it is used. It's less prone to errors.
